# The-2023-Tech-Layoff-Surge-Timing-Industry-Impact-Capital-Analysis
I developed an interactive Tableau dashboard analyzing global tech layoffs from 2020–2024 to uncover when workforce reductions peaked, which industries were most impacted, and whether funding levels mitigated layoffs.

Using time-series analysis, I identified a sharp acceleration in layoffs beginning in late 2022, with January 2023 marking the peak month. Industry segmentation revealed that Retail led total workforce reductions during the contraction year, followed by Consumer and Hardware sectors. A funding-to-layoffs correlation analysis showed only a weak relationship, suggesting that higher capital reserves did not meaningfully shield firms during the downturn.

The dashboard integrates trend analysis, industry comparison, regression modeling, and cross-sheet interactivity to provide a multi-dimensional view of the 2023 tech contraction.
